# Advent of Go Code
This project is a golang response to the 25 days of challenges at http://adventofcode.com.

## Notes
* The answers are not posted
* Execute most solutions via `cat input.txt | go run main.go` or `go run main.go < input.txt`
* Execute some solutions via `go run main.go [argument]`
* sometimes main.go is used both for part 1 and part 2
* sometimes part 1 was commented out to solve part 2
* sometimes part1 and part2 are managed by cli argument
